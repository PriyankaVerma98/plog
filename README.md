# Prolog Encoding of Firewall rules

Firewall rules were encoded in SWI-Prolog as facts and rules. Based on the set of rules an incoming packet could be:
* accept (allow the incoming packet) 
* reject (send reject information to sender) 
* drop (silently) 

***

## System Requirements

The program should be run using swi-prolog and the input instructions should be followed for successful working of the engine .

* This project was completed in partial fulfilment of the course *Logic in Computer Science* at BITS Pilani.
