# Prolog Encoding of Firewall rules



Firewall rules were encoded in SWI-Prolog as facts and rules. Based on set of clauses an incoming packet could be:
* accept (allow the incoming packet) 
* reject (send reject information to sender) 
* drop (silently)

* This project was completed in partial fulfilment of the course *Logic in Computer Science* at BITS Pilani.
